* Installing nix
** Linux
You can use any linux distribution with =systemd= (requirement of the nix package manager).

First let's get nix installed.

#+begin_src bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
If you need to install nix without root permission then use their single user installation from their [[https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux][website]].
#+end_quote

** Windows
#+begin_quote
⚠️ Currently a work in progress
#+end_quote
First we need to make sure that we have the WSL installed and upgraded to version 2.

#+begin_quote
If you are using Windows 10 before the 2004 update, follow the [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual][instructions here]].
#+end_quote

1. Open powershell with admin privileges.
2. Run the command =wsl --install= and after its ran, restart your computer.
3. Now we need to install wsl again through Microsoft Store using [[this link][aka.ms/wslstorepage]].
4. Install Ubuntu using =wsl --install -d Ubuntu=.

#+begin_quote
To verify that WSL is installed properly by trying to run the command =wsl --version= in powershell. If you see 5-10 lines of output you've installed it correctly. If you see a lot of random stuff (the help menu) printed, get some help.
#+end_quote

*** Installing Nix on WSL Ubuntu
#+begin_quote
As of writing this, systemd is automatically enabled. If you have an older installation of WSL you can check this by running =systemctl status=. If it returns command not found, get help.
#+end_quote

Open an Ubuntu terminal window and install =nix=.

#+begin_src bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
#+end_src


** macOS
First let's get nix installed.

#+begin_src bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
#+end_src

* Nix configuration

We now want to make our nix configuration file have the following config.

Edit =/etc/nix/nix.conf= using your favourite text editor with root permissions.

Remember to replace =<USER>= with your username.

#+begin_src conf

build-users-group = nixbld
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
trusted-users = <USER> root
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
If you chose the single user installation then you will need to edit =~/.config/nix/nix.conf= rather than =/etc/nix/nix.conf=.
#+end_quote

Now we need to restart =nix-daemon= for our config to work.

#+begin_src bash
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon
#+end_src

* Development Shell

You can now access the developmental shell by running this command.

#+begin_src bash
nix develop github:hegde-atri/nix-ros2 --impure
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
We use the =impure= flag here as we want access to the system to decide drivers for openGL.
#+end_quote
